Summary
======
My academic journey began with an interdisciplinary Bioinformatics undergraduate program at Huazhong Agricultural University, laying a strong foundation in computer science, mathematics, and biology. 

My doctoral research at Shanghai Jiao Tong University focused on bacterial Integrative and Conjugative Elements (ICE). I developed and applied diverse computational methods to analyze massive ICE sequence data, focusing on functional modules such as integration and conjugative transfer. My research led to the creation of several groundbreaking bioinformatic tools, including the [***ICEberg 2.0 database***](https://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/ICEberg2/index.php) for heterogeneous ICE data representation, [***ICE ontology (ICEO)***](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/iceo.html) for massive ICE data standardized, [***ICEfinder tool***](https://bioinfo-mml.sjtu.edu.cn/ICEfinder/ICEfinder.html) for precise ICE in silico identification, and ***NanoMGE tool*** for mobile genetic elements detection from long-read Nanopore metagenomic data. These innovative contributions have propelled the study of ICE's horizontal transfer and played a vital role in reducing the spread of virulence and antibiotic resistance. The work about the ICEberg 2.0 database and ICEfinder tool was published in [***Nucleic Acids Research***](https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/47/D1/D660/5165266) and recognized as a 2020 ESI highly cited paper. And the ICEO work, which was conducted during my one-year visit to the University of Michigan Medical School, was published in [***Scientific Data***](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-021-01112-5) and presented at multiple international conferences.

Motivated by a desire to make a more direct impact on human health and patient outcomes, I embarked on a new journey in a leading Chinese pharmaceutical company’s Translational Medicine R&D center as a Bioinformatic Scientist III after graduation. My role involved various aspects of oncology and drug development, such as biomarker and gene target identification, disease understanding, and indication expansion.
